      "Travel expenses incurred for flights scheduled between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM or on weekends (from Friday 9:00 PM to Monday 5:00 AM) will include a multiplier of 1.1 to address the increased costs associated with off-hours travel.\n",

      "\t•\tSeasonal and Location Adjustment for New York during New Year: 1.2\n",
      "\t•\tUrgency Multiplier for last-minute booking: 1.3\n",
      "The total allowable expense for this travel scenario would be $2,500 * 1.1 * 1.2 * 1.3 = $4,158.\n",
      "\n",
